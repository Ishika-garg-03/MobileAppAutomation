# MobileAppAutomation
This repository contains a fully automated end-to-end flow for simulating the process of logging into the Google Play Store, installing Amazon application, signing into Amazon, and adding a product to the cart. The project uses tools like Selenium for browser automation and Appium for mobile application automation to perform these tasks.
